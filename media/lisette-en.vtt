Hi everyone and welcome to UN

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.359
Architecture. I wanted to talk a little

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.280
bit about what we do here at UN

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.519
Architecture and what kind of sets us

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.160
apart from other architecture

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.000
businesses. Um we combine a lot of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.640
modern design with um

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
with our natural surroundings. So we use

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.240
a lot of what is already there, hills,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.400
um wood

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.279
kind we kind of build it into the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.519
natural surroundings. Um we like to use

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.519
a very

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.719
energyefficient and environmentally

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.399
friendly style of design. Um, we want it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.920
to be super functional and super

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.440
beautiful and just kind of make sure

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.840
that it's everything that our client

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.440
wants. We build it specifically to your

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.840
needs and um,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.520
we are very client-based, so we want it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.320
to be perfect for our clients. And yeah,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.320
that's a little bit about
